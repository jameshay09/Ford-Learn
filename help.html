  <h5>What is Practice Test?</h5>
  <p>Practice Test is the feature of the app that allows you to take a Practice Driving Test so that you can prepare yourself for the actual test. The route the you are taking will turn green as you drive. The Practice Test given will be exactly the same as the real thing. The whole test will be recorded by the dash-cam. 
  <br />
  <br />
  If you make a minor mistake, that part of the route will turn orange and if you make a major mistake, it will turn red. At the end of the test, you will be given a breakdown of your results and will be able to see exactly where you made the mistakes by clicking on the orange or red sections of the map. This will then show you a video of the mistake so you can see exactly what you did wrong. </p>
